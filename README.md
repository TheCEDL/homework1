# Homework1 - Introduce a New NN with Memory 
* Team Member : 邱志堯 , 劉兆寧, 曾守曜 ,簡光宏
* Paper title : Semantic Object Parsing with Graph LSTM (ECCV2016)
* Paper link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07063v1.pdf

# Briefly intro of paper
**The topic in this paper is semantic object parsing which aims to segment an object within an image into multiple parts** with more fine-grained semantics. Many high level computer vision applications can benefit from a powerful semantic object parser, including action recognition, clothes recognition and retrieval and human behavior analysis.

# To-Do
* [+10] Please find a recent paper (2014-2015) which introduced a NN with memory.
* [+50] Write a report to briefly introduce the paper;
* [+40] then, focus on discussing the unique properties of the new NN and where it can be applied to take advantage of the properties.
