# CEDL Homework1 - Introduce a New NN with Memory 

## Paper Title
**Gated Feedback Recurrent Neural Networks** <br>
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02367v4.pdf


# Motivation
NN with Memory can potentially to be used to acompplish many AI related tasks: Reasoning, Decision Making, etc. <br>

# To-Do
* [+10] Please find a recent paper (2014-2015) which introduced a NN with memory.
* [+50] Write a report to briefly introduce the paper;
* [+40] then, focus on discussing the unique properties of the new NN and where it can be applied to take advantage of the properties.
