Please complete each homework for each team, and <br>
mention who contributed which parts in your report.

# Motivation
NN with Memory can potentially to be used to acompplish many AI related tasks: Reasoning, Decision Making, etc. <br>
Here are some related talks:<br>
* Sumit Chopra from Facebook. Reasoning, Attention and Memory <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_wzP_JlVFcKbHdpYVdZMjg3eTBQd2F1OG9QZlVhOGJoX0dz">slides</a>
* Edward Grefenstette from Google DeepMind. Beyond Seq2Seq with Augmented RNNs  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_wzP_JlVFcKYTFaTVFJN18tbmtkX2V0WEEtWXVSdDV4UHVZ">slides</a>

# To-Do
* [+10] Please find a recent paper (2014-2015) which introduced a NN with memory.
* [+50] Write a report to briefly introduce the paper;
* [+40] then, focus on discussing the unique properties of the new NN and where it can be applied to take advantage of the properties.
